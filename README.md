# Timeline Visualizer #
## Introduction ##
The Timeline Visualizer window can be used to display the *PlayableGraph* of any *Timeline* bound to a *PlayableDirector* Component in the scene.
The tool can be used in both Play and Edit mode and will always reflect the current state of the graph.
Playable Handles in the graph are represented by colored nodes, varying according to their type. Wire color intensity indicates the local weight of the blending.
